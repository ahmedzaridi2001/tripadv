// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity, I will provide a placeholder file with the necessary fixes based on the provided updates.  This assumes the original file used `it`, `is`, `and`, `correct`, and `brevity` without declaring them.  A common scenario is that these are used within a testing context, or perhaps as shorthand boolean variables.  Without the original code, I'll assume they are boolean variables initialized to `true`.
