// Since the original code was left out for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the component uses these variables without importing or declaring them.
// I will add placeholder declarations for these variables to resolve the issue.
// In a real scenario, I would examine the original code to determine the correct import or declaration.

const does = null // Placeholder declaration
const not = null // Placeholder declaration
const need = null // Placeholder declaration
const any = null // Placeholder declaration
const modifications = null // Placeholder declaration

// Assume the rest of the component code uses these variables.
// Without the original code, I cannot provide a complete solution.
// This is a placeholder to address the reported errors.

// Example usage (replace with actual component logic):
console.log(does, not, need, any, modifications)

// In a real scenario, the component code would be here, using the declared variables.
